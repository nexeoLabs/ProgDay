# ProgDay
A simple coin for programmers day at nexeo

just clone the repo then run ``` npm install ``` from within the directory
install embark using npm and run ``` embark run ``` and you're good to go !

The program fires a local blockchain and a local coin that can be integrated into metamask.

Enjoy ! :-)
